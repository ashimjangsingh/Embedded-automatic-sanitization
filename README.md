# Embedded-automatic-sanitization
An Embedded Automatic Sanitization System is a touch-free device designed to dispense sanitizer automatically when a hand is detected. It works using an embedded control unit (such as a microcontroller), a sensor (like an IR sensor) to detect hand presence, and a pump controlled through a relay module to spray or release sanitizer.
